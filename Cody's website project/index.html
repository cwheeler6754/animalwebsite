                <h2>My Other Animals</h2>
                <p>Some animals which are not included in this website would be my dogs, chickens, and hamsters.My
                  chihuahua
                  is called Mars. The next dog is Neila, Alien spelled backwards. She is a Tibetan Spaniel. We have a
                  total
                  of 8 chickens. I enjoyed having hamsters, unfortunately it has been a while since I have had one.</p>
