            <h2>Betta Fish</h2>
            <p>A Betta fish is one of the easiet fish to take care of. Tank mates include aquatic frogs, nano shrimp, snails, and other bettas only when they are both females. The
              diet for betta fish and other tank mates are the betta pellets you can find anywhere. The tanks
              I use has a built in filter and light which are essential to bettas. Lights should be turned on
              during the day and off at night. A filter will make cleaning the tank easier as most of the
              gunk will get sucked up.</p>

                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p> I have a five gallon tank with one betta, an aquatic frog, and a small fish which I do not 
                  know the name of. I have another tank (not pictured) which includes a betta and another aquatic
                  frog. I have had betta fish forever. My betta pictured is over 5 years old. Betta fish only live
                  for 5 years so I am worried he is going to pass away. The betta not pictured is almost 8 months old 
                  as I got her as a baby and raised her. She was smaller than a dime and now she is full grown.
                   I highly recommend everyone getting a betta fish as a pet!
