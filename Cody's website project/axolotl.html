            <h2>Axolotl</h2>
            <p>An axolotl is a mexican water salamander. They remain in water as they
              are fish reptiles. One important thing to know about the habitat is never to use gravel or pebbels
              as the substrate. Sand is the best since they are bottom feeders and sand will not impact them like
              gravel. Diet consists of nightcrawlers, shrimp pellets, or feeder fish. I fed shrimp pellets to
              Jeffery as they are less messy. Water will stay cloudy for a while until the sand settels. A house which
              they can hind in is important as they are not fans of light. </p>

                <h2>Jeffery</h2>
                <p>Jeffery was an Axolotl. Jeffery wass one of the most challenging pets Ihave had. He passed away 
                  two years ago after having him for almost 3 years. I always wanted an axolotl as I thought they were 
                  cool looking and interesting. I found Jeffery at a local pet store and had to have him. I enjoyed him 
                  even though he was the most challenging pet I had.
